This is my back up of dotfiles, i don't use so much program to be honest.
 
* Window Manager

So you just need this some programs to do it 

+ I3 Gaps : default WM ,coz had "gaps" in it
+ Rofi : The Launcher for programs
+ kitty : default terminal, i choose kitty can show image
+ zsh+oh-my-zsh : default shell ofc, also don't forget to install oh-my-zsh
+ vscodium : coding programs
+ pcmanfm-qt/pcmanfm-gtk3 : default file manager , yes i still use a gui file manager, if you prefer to had nice look i suggest to use pcmanfm-gtk3 instead pcmanfm-qt ,coz pcmanfm-qt theme little bit weird
+ mpv : for playing videos
+ htop : task manager ofc
+ bumblebee-status : default status bar for i3 bar, i using this coz is had many feature compared to i3blocks/status ,for more module u can find it in bumblebee-status site
+ cmus : default music player
+ xarchiver : for the archive manager

That's it 
Thanks For Coming!!
